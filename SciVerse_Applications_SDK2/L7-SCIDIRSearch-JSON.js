However, some peptides and regulatory proteins can cross the BBB by saturable and non-saturable mechanisms. Leptin and insulin each cross the BBB by their own transporters. Impaired transport of leptin occurs in obesity and accounts for peripheral resistance; that is, the condition wherein an obese animal loses weight when given leptin directly into the brain but not when given leptin peripherally. Leptin transport is also inhibited in starvation and by hypertriglyceridemia. Since hypertriglyceridemia occurs in both starvation and obesity, we have postulated that the peripheral resistance induced by hypertriglyceridemia may have evolved as an adaptive mechanism in response to starvation. Insulin transport is also regulated. For example, treatment of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases insulin transport across the BBB by about threefold. Since many of the actions of CNS insulin oppose those of peripheral insulin and since LPS releases proinflammatory cytokines, enhanced transport of insulin across the BBB could be a mechanism which promotes insulin resistance in sepsis. The brain endothelial cells which comprise the BBB secrete many substances including cytokines. Such secretion can be stimulated from one side of the BBB with release into the other side. For example, it appears that adiponectin can inhibit release of interleukin-6 from brain endothelial cells. Overall, the BBB represents an important interface in mediating gut?brain axes.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) also conveys information between the CNS and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through several mechanisms. Here, we review three of those mechanisms. First, the BBB selectively transports some peptides and regulatory proteins in the blood-to-brain or the brain-to-blood direction. The ability of GI hormones to affect functions of the BBB, as illustrated by the ability of insulin to alter the BBB transport of amino acids and drugs, represents a second mechanism. A third mechanism is the ability of GI hormones to affect the secretion by the BBB of substances that themselves affect feeding and appetite, such as nitric oxide and cytokines. By these and other mechanisms, the BBB regulates communications between the CNS and GI tract.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

To this end, the gastric mucosa is innervated by intrinsic sensory neurons and two populations of extrinsic sensory neurons: vagal and spinal afferents. Extrinsic afferent neurons constitute an emergency system that is called into operation when the gastrointestinal mucosa is endangered by noxious chemicals. The function of these chemoceptive afferents can selectively be manipulated and explored with the use of capsaicin which acts via a cation channel termed TRPV1. Many of the homeostatic actions of spinal afferents are brought about by transmitter release from their peripheral endings. When stimulated by noxious chemicals, these afferents enhance gastrointestinal blood flow and activate hyperaemia-dependent and hyperaemia-independent mechanisms of protection and repair. In the rodent foregut these local regulatory roles of sensory neurons are mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide and nitric oxide. The pathophysiological potential of the neural emergency system is best portrayed by the gastric hyperaemic response to acid back-diffusion, which is governed by spinal afferent nerve fibres. This mechanism limits damage to the surface of the mucosa and creates favourable conditions for rapid restitution and healing of the wounded mucosa. Other extrinsic afferent neurons, particularly in the vagus nerve, subserve gastrointestinal homeostasis by signalling noxious events in the foregut to the central nervous system and eliciting autonomic, emotional-affective and neuroendocrine reactions. Under conditions of inflammation and injury, chemoceptive afferents are sensitized to peripheral stimuli and in this functional state contribute to the hyperalgesia associated with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, if GI pain is to be treated by sensory neuron-directed drugs it needs to be considered that these drugs do not inhibit nociception at the expense of GI mucosal vulnerability.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

Plasma IFN levels were measured in venous blood draining from abdominal organs that are normally in contact with exogenous and endogenous interferon inducers. The results obtained from three rodent species indicate the presence of a venous-arterial and GALT venous-peripheral venous gradient, suggesting that at least some of the IFN produced in the GALT and spleen is absorbed via blood capillaries and detectable in the regional vessels. Owing to the rapid turnover of IFN, arterial or peripheral venous blood showed a basal level.

The <emph typestyle=\"it\">AgCP</emph> open reading frame is 60.4% identical at the nucleotide level to a blackfly, <emph typestyle=\"it\">Simulium vittatum</emph>, carboxypeptidase gene. The transcriptional start site of <emph typestyle=\"it\">AgCP</emph> was determined by primer extension. Expression of <emph typestyle=\"it\">AgCP</emph> mRNA is detectable in the guts of pupae and sugar-fed adult female mosquitoes and is induced (?10-fold) within 3<lnsm:hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>h of a blood meal. By 24<lnsm:hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>h after a blood meal, mRNA abundance returns to a level close to that present before a blood meal.

The potential use of the <emph typestyle=\"it\">AgCP</emph> promoter for driving the expression of genes that hinder the development of parasites in the mosquito gut is discussed.</p></lnsm:abs>",

Brief struggling behaviours are known to decrease blood flow to the gut (GBF). Likewise, prolonged swimming in unfed fish has been shown to reduce GBF in proportion to the increased oxygen uptake. Therefore, the normal postprandial increase in GBF theoretically should be impaired whenever fish are active. However, indirect evidence suggests that GBF is spared to some degree when fed fish swim continuously but at a cost (10?15%) to their critical swimming speed. Severe respiratory acidosis can be created by the new intensive aquaculture settings that use oxygen injection into re-circulated water. The only study so far to examine the effects of severe hypercapnia on GBF and its regulation showed that routine GBF and ?-adrenergic control of GBF remained normal in unfed white sturgeon (<emph typestyle=\"it\">Acipenser transmontanus</emph>). However, severe hypercapnia produced a hyperactive state and increased sensitivity of GBF to struggling. As a result, routine GBF was maintained for a short period of time. Thus, environmental changes such as severe hypercapnia can indirectly impact GBF through altered struggling behaviour, but the implications of the overall reduction in GBF to food assimilation have yet to be established.</p></lnsm:abs>",

Pittman-Moore mini-pigs (n = 6) were chronically instrumented with aortic, pulmonary arterial (Swan-Ganz), and mesenteric venous catheters and an intestinal tonometer. Blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery was measured with an ultrasonic flow probe. On the day of the experiment, data were obtained before and during halothane administration (1.5% end-tidal). Halothane caused a marked decrease in mesenteric blood flow, associated with an increase in mesenteric vascular resistance. Likewise mesenteric oxygen delivery and consumption were significantly decreased under halothane, while the oxygen extraction rate of the intestine was not significantly changed. There was no significant change in intramucosal gut pH after halothane administration, which indicates that an adequate mucosal tissue oxygenation was maintained. We conclude that the marked halothane-induced reduction in mesenteric blood flow did not seem to impair the oxygenation of the gut mucosa in our experimental model.</p></lnsm:abs>",

Our previous studies indicated that <emph typestyle=\"it\">Haemaphysalis</emph> <emph typestyle=\"it\">longicornis</emph> midgut-specific asparaginyl endopeptidases/legumains, HlLgm and HlLgm2, act in the Hb digestion cascade. Here, we investigated the potential of these enzymes in blood feeding and digestion, midgut remodelling and reproduction of ticks by employing RNA interference (RNAi) techniques. Injection of <emph typestyle=\"it\">HlLgm-</emph> and <emph typestyle=\"it\">HlLgm2</emph> gene-specific double-stranded RNAs into unfed adult female <emph typestyle=\"it\">H</emph>. <emph typestyle=\"it\">longicornis</emph> caused gene-specific transcriptional and translational disruptions. RNAi impacted on tick blood feeding leading to death of the feeding ticks, failure of ticks to reach repletion and significant reductions in engorged tick body weight. Histological examination revealed that deletion of legumains resulted in damage to the midgut tissues and disruption of normal cellular remodelling during feeding. Gene knock-down also caused significantly delayed onset of oviposition, reduced number of eggs and, most strikingly, structurally deformed eggs that failed to hatch suggesting imperfect embryogenesis. Synergistic impacts of RNAi were reflected on all parameters evaluated when <emph typestyle=\"it\">HlLgm</emph> and <emph typestyle=\"it\">HlLgm2</emph> were silenced together. These findings suggest that legumains may play modulatory roles in blood feeding and digestion, midgut cellular remodelling and embryogenesis in <emph typestyle=\"it\">H</emph>. <emph typestyle=\"it\">longicornis</emph>. Deletion of legumains in <emph typestyle=\"it\">H</emph>. <emph typestyle=\"it\">longicornis</emph> would help in controlling the tick population and thereby transmission of diseases to their hosts.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

To better define the adequacy of gut blood flow and oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass, we measured overall gut blood flow and ileal mucosal flow and their relationship to mucosal pH, mesenteric oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption in immature pigs (<emph typestyle=\"it\">n</emph> = 8). Normothermic, noncrossclamped, right atrium?to?aorta cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained at 100 ml/kg per minute for 120 minutes. Animals were instrumented with an ultrasonic Doppler flow probe on the superior mesenteric artery, a mucosal laser Doppler flow probe in the ileum, and pH tonometers in the stomach, ileum, and rectum. Radioactive microspheres were injected before and at 5, 60, and 120 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass for tissue blood flow measurements. Overall gut blood flow significantly increased during cardiopulmonary bypass as evidenced by increases in superior mesenteric arterial flow to 134.1% ± 8.0%, 137.1% ± 7.5%, 130.3% ± 11.2%, and 130.2% ± 12.7% of baseline values at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of bypass, respectively. Conversely, ileal mucosal blood flow significantly decreased to 53.6% ± 6.4%, 49.5% ± 6.8%, 58.9% ± 11.6%, and 47.8% ± 10.0% of baseline values, respectively. Blood flow measured with microspheres was significantly increased to proximal portions of the gut, duodenum and jejunum, during cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas blood flow to distal portions, ileum and colon, was unchanged. Gut mucosal pH decreased progressively during cardiopulmonary bypass and paralleled the decrease in ileal mucosal blood flow. Mesenteric oxygen delivery decreased significantly from 67.0 ± 10.0 ml/min per square meter at baseline to 42.4 ± 4.6, 44.9 ± 3.5, 46.0 ± 3.6, and 42.9 ± 3.9 ml/min per square meter at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of bypass. Despite the decrease in mesenteric oxygen delivery, mesenteric oxygen consumption increased progressively from 10.8 ± 1.4 ml/min per square meter at baseline to 13.4 ± 1.2, 15.9 ± 1.2, 16.7 ± 1.4, and 16.6 ± 1.54 ml/min per square meter, respectively. We conclude that gut mucosal ischemia during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass results from a combination of redistribution of blood flow away from mucosa and an increased oxygen demand.

Responses were compared with those to rHb1.1, a recombinant-hemoglobin solution with a wild-type NO-scavenging rate, as well as an oncotically matched albumin solution. In a fixed-pressure (40 mm Hg) rat model of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation, rHb2.0 and albumin both restored mean arterial pressure (MAP) to baseline values, whereas rHb1.1 increased MAP to 27% above the baseline value. Mesenteric vascular resistance after resuscitation with rHb2.0 was 57% less than that with rHb1.1. rHb2.0 was found to have 55% greater intestinal oxygen delivery (D<lnsm:typestyle value=\"smcaps\">o</lnsm:typestyle><sub loc=\"post\">2int</sub>) and resulted in a 27% lower oxygen-extraction rate than did rHb1.1 after resuscitation.

Under these conditions, methods of supporting gut physiology may prevent the sequelae of gut ischemic damage. Enteral feeding is known to cause splanchnic hyperemia in uninjured animals. In order to study the effects of continuous enteral feeding on gut hemodynamics in a flow-limited environment, six dogs underwent the insertion of arterial, pulmonary artery, and portal and hepatic vein catheters. Splenectomy and duodenostomy were performed, and the hepatic artery and portal vein were encircled with flow probes. Lung injury (LI) was undertaken with intravenous oleic acid (0.08 mL/kg), followed by incremental additions of PEEP totaling 10 cm H<sub loc=\"post\">2</sub>O to correct shunt. Continuous elemental feeding (1 kcal/mL, 3 mL/kg/hr) was started through the duodenostomy. Cardiac index (CI), PBF, and gut oxygen delivery and consumption (GO<sub loc=\"post\">2</sub>D, GO<sub loc=\"post\">2</sub>C) were measured at baseline (T0), 1 hour after LI and PEEP (T1), and 1 hour after drip feeding was begun (T2).

While many methods have been utilized in measuring tissue blood flow, the one most often practiced today is dependent on injection of radioactively labeled microspheres. The theoretical basis of the microsphere technique is analogous to that of the indicator-dilution method. A bolus of microspheres suspended in a suitable vehicle is injected into the left atrium or left ventricle where they mix uniformly with the oxygenated blood. They are then distributed via aortic blood flow to the capillary beds within each organ in proportion to the volume of microsphere-containing blood. Technical aspects of tissue processing, gamma energy detection, and gamma spectrum analysis are reviewed. Sources of experimental error and techniques for their reduction are also discussed.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

Enterocytes isolated from the proximal and distal regions of the small intestine of sucklings aged 12?52 days, and reacted with indicator SRBC at pH 6.0 or 7.2, bound opossum IgG in rosette assays. Considerable overall variation was observed in the numbers of enterocytes forming rosettes. No binding was seen with rabbit IgG at these ages, or with opossum and rabbit IgG when enterocytes were obtained from opossums aged 55?73 days. Opossum anti-SRBC antibody (IgG) fed to sucklings at 52 days and earlier (but not later) could subsequently be detected in the serum. However, rabbit anti-SRBC antibody (IgG) could not be detected in the blood serum when fed to sucklings of any age. Fluorescent tracing of FITC-labelled opossum and rabbit IgG fed to suckling opossums, and of endogenous opossum IgG, pointed to transport of the homologous IgG occurring across gut enterocytes of the proximal region. These results suggest that IgG is recognised and transcytosed by specific Fc?Rs present on opossum enterocytes prior to weaning.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

Previous studies on changes in lymphocyte composition have used flow cytometry to study peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL?s), or cells isolated from rodent tissue, and have yielded conflicting results. We have used immunohistochemistry to determine whether the B and T cells in human tissue from spleen and gut are affected by age. Areas of germinal centre, mantle zone and marginal zone of B cell follicles were measured. In addition, CD4 and CD8 T cells in T cell areas and in B cell follicles were counted. We observed a striking age-related decrease in the proportion of CD8+ T cells in the T cell zones of the spleen. This decrease was not apparent in the T cell population that occupies splenic B cell areas, or in GALT. Further differences, in CD4+ cells, were seen between T cell populations in the T cell zones and those in B cell areas. These findings highlight differences between lymphocyte populations in different lymphoid tissues, and different compartments within each tissue, which may be of importance in future studies of the ageing immune system.</p></lnsm:abs>",

The experimental diets consisted of a wheat-based diet supplemented with 0 or 1<lnsm:hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>g/kg enzyme preparation (xylanase activity was 1218<lnsm:hsp sp=\"0.25\"/>U/g). The diets were fed between 7 and 49 days of age. Enzyme supplementation (ES) improved (P&lt;0.05) growth performance and feed conversion efficiency. The addition of enzyme to a wheat-based diet reduced the relative weights of the duodenum, jejunum, pancreas (P&lt;0.05) and colon (P&lt;0.01) in 21-day-old broiler chickens. Enzyme preparation reduced digesta viscosity in the proventriculus and jejunum of 21-day-old broiler chickens (P&lt;0.05) and in colon of 49-day-old broiler chickens (P&lt;0.05). The pH of the digesta in the crop, duodenum and jejunum was increased (P&lt;0.05) in 21-day-old broiler chickens and was reduced in the caecum of 49-day-old broiler chickens (P&lt;0.05) with enzymes. There was no significant difference between the two experimental groups in counts of lactobacillus and coliform bacteria in the caecum. Enzyme supplementation increased the concentration of blood insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (P&lt;0.01) of 21-day-old broilers, triiodothyronine (T<sub loc=\"post\">3</sub>) and insulin (P&lt;0.05) at 49 days. ES reduced the concentrations of blood thyroxine (T<sub loc=\"post\">4</sub>) (P&lt;0.01) and uric acid (P&lt;0.05) at 49 days, but had no effect on glucose concentration (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, ES can improve performance and digestive parameters and can change some blood parameters in broiler chickens fed a wheat-based diet.</p></lnsm:view></lnsm:abs>",

In subjects with healthy gastrointestinal tracts, lavage-fluid haemoglobin concentrations were 0·5-5·1 mg/L, equivalent to daily blood loss of 0·1-1·1 mL. High concentrations were found for patients with colorectal cancer, severe diverticular disease, and rectal varices, in seven of sixteen patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, and in four patients with iron-deficiency anaemia thought to be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. In these four patients, estimated blood loss ranged from 2·6-24·5 mL per day. This method could have various research and clinical applications.</p></lnsm:abs>",
